This is the procedural macro crate for [`termcolor_output`].

Please do not depend on this macro directly. The dual-crate system is a rather hacky way
for this crate to ever exist on stable (in fact, it is the re-implementation of [`proc_macro_hack`]).

For further documentation, please refer to the wrapper crate.
